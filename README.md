Here's a README file template for your **Password Cracker** project, which includes multiple scripts such as `brute_force_random.py`, `brute_force_characters.py`, `brute_force_while.py`, and `how_random_works.py`.

# Password Cracker

This repository contains Python scripts to demonstrate various methods of cracking passwords using brute-force techniques. These scripts are educational and are designed to show how brute-force attacks can be implemented. **Only use these scripts for ethical purposes with explicit permission to test the security of your own systems.**

## Scripts Included

### 1. `brute_force_random.py`
This script performs a brute-force attack using randomly generated combinations of characters. It tries all possible combinations within a given character set until it matches the target password.

### 2. `brute_force_characters.py`
This script brute-forces passwords by iterating through a predefined set of characters (such as lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters). It generates all possible combinations for a given password length.

### 3. `brute_force_while.py`
This script implements a brute-force password cracker using a `while` loop. It continually generates possible passwords and checks if they match the target until the correct one is found.

### 4. `how_random_works.py`
This script demonstrates how random number generation works in Python and how it can be utilized in brute-force attacks to generate random passwords efficiently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `string` library (included in Python standard library)
- `time` library (included in Python standard library)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-cracker.git
cd password-cracker
```

## Usage

Each of the scripts is designed to be run independently. Below are instructions for running each script.

### 1. `brute_force_random.py`

```bash
python brute_force_random.py <target_password>
```

This script attempts to crack the provided password using random character combinations. 

#### Example:

```bash
python brute_force_random.py "abc123"
```

This will start trying random combinations to match `"abc123"`.

### 2. `brute_force_characters.py`

```bash
python brute_force_characters.py <target_password> <max_length>
```

This script will attempt to crack the password by iterating over all possible combinations of characters (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters).

#### Example:

```bash
python brute_force_characters.py "password123" 12
```

This will start generating all combinations of characters up to length 12 to match `"password123"`.

### 3. `brute_force_while.py`

```bash
python brute_force_while.py <target_password>
```

This script uses a `while` loop to generate potential passwords, checking each one until it matches the target password.

#### Example:

```bash
python brute_force_while.py "admin123"
```

It will keep trying passwords in a brute-force manner until it finds `"admin123"`.

### 4. `how_random_works.py`

```bash
python how_random_works.py
```

This script demonstrates how random number generation works and how it can be used for generating passwords in a brute-force attack.

## Output

Each script will display progress as it tries different combinations, and once the correct password is found, it will output the cracked password along with the time taken to crack it.

Example output:

```
Cracked password: password123
Time taken: 0.027 seconds
```
